description: |-
  The volume of distribution at steady state (VDss) measures the degree
  of a drug's concentration in the body tissue compared to concentration in the blood.
  Higher VD indicates a higher distribution in the tissue and usually indicates
  the drug with high lipid solubility, low plasma protein binding rate.
