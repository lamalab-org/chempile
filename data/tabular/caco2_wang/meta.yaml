  The human colon epithelial cancer cell line, Caco-2,
  is used as an in vitro model to simulate the human intestinal tissue.
  The experimental result on the rate of drug passing through
  the Caco-2 cells can approximate the rate at which the drug permeates
  through the human intestinal tissue.
